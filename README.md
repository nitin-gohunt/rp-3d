# Reverse Proxy Template

_This repository should not be deployed on its own!_

This repository is a template meant to be forked and modified for each specific
proxy that needs to be produced. It lays the groundwork as well as possible to
create an easy-to-maintain and well-documented description of how we are getting
the best out of our nginx proxy.

After forking the repository, remember to `mv Jenkinsfile.template Jenkinsfile`,
otherwise Jenkins will go on happily ignoring your repository!
